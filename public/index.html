						<p>The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Computer, lights up! Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. </p>

						<p> Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Your head is not an artifact! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?</p>
